- Batters will retire at 25 runs, although can return if the remainder of the team is out.
- Bowlers are limited to 4 overs per innings.
- Agreement about umpiring, wides, lbw and other matters to be agreed between the two participating captains. The emphasis of the competition is on social cricket ðŸ˜Š
